## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Floating button not appearing
**Solution:** Refresh the webpage after installing the extension

### Issue: Extension icon not showing
**Solution:** The extension will work with a default gray icon. See ICONS_GUIDE.md to add custom icons

### Issue: Cannot save notes
**Solution:** 
- Check if extension has storage permission (it should by default)
- Open DevTools console and look for errors
