## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Manifest Version**: V3 (latest Chrome extension standard)
- **Storage**: `chrome.storage.local` API
- **Encryption**: Caesar cipher (shift 7) + Base64 encoding
- **Permissions**: `storage`, `activeTab`

### Encryption

Notes are encrypted before storage using a two-step process:

1. **Caesar Cipher**: Each character's code is shifted by 7
2. **Base64 Encoding**: The result is encoded in Base64

This provides basic obfuscation. For production use, consider stronger encryption methods like AES.

### Storage Format

```javascript
{
  "notes": {
    "example.com": [
      {
        "content": "encrypted_content_here",
        "timestamp": 1696723200000,
        "domain": "example.com"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ **Chrome**: Fully supported (version 88+)
- ‚úÖ **Edge**: Fully supported (Chromium-based)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Firefox**: Requires manifest modifications
- ‚ùå **Safari**: Not supported (requires different extension format)

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes**:

1. The encryption used is **basic obfuscation**, not military-grade encryption
2. Notes are stored locally in the browser's storage
3. Do NOT store highly sensitive information (passwords, credit cards, etc.)
4. For better security, consider:
   - Using Web Crypto API for stronger encryption
   - Implementing password protection
   - Using server-side storage with proper authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading
- Ensure Developer Mode is enabled
- Check the console for error messages
- Verify all files are present

### Floating Button Not Appearing
- Refresh the webpage after installing the extension
- Check if the website blocks content scripts
- Open browser console and look for errors

### Notes Not Saving
- Check browser storage permissions
- Verify the domain is being extracted correctly
- Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Local Storage

### Cannot Open Popup from Floating Button
- This is a Manifest V3 limitation
- Users must click the extension icon in the toolbar
- The floating button serves as a reminder/quick indicator

## Development

### Local Development
1. Make changes to any file
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click the refresh icon on the extension card
4. Test your changes

### Adding New Features
- Modify `popup.js` for UI logic changes
- Modify `content.js` for webpage interaction
- Modify `utils.js` for encryption/utility functions
- Update `manifest.json` for new permissions or scripts
